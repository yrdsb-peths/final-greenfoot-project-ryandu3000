# Final Greenfoot Project

Overview

My game is a math game where a math question will appear on the big box with four different possible answers on small boxes beside it. Select the correct answer before the rocket hits you. When you get hit by a rocket or you select the wrong answer the game will end.
- Be sure to click the white area of the square and not on the number itself.

Levels and Scoring
- Every question you get correctly will result in your score going up by 1
- Every 10 score has your level go up by 1 which will then increase the game difficulty
    - harder math questions
    - less time to answer
